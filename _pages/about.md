I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at MIT, working with [Talia Tamarin-Brodsky](https://taliatamarin.wixsite.com/taliatamarin). My research focuses on the intersection of atmospheric dynamics and climate science, applying theories and methodologies of organized weather systems to advance our understanding of climate variability and change. 

At MIT, I investigate the role of moisture in Rossby wave breaking and its influence on the organization of the midlatitude storm tracks. These processes are relevant for high impact weather such as blocking and cyclone clustering, yet they remain a major source of uncertainty in current climate models. Therefore, improving our understanding of how moisture affects the midlatitude storm tracks is essential for improving confidence in future climate projections. This project is funded through a [Postdoc.Mobility grant](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/230407) from the Swiss National Science Foundation. 

I received my PhD in Atmospheric and Climate Science from ETH Zurich, where I worked with Lukas Papritz, Michael Sprenger, and [Heini Wernli](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-dynamics.html). My doctoral research examined the global atmospheric energy cycle and the role of individual weather systems in shaping it. In collaboration with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, I also studied the influence of the Gulf Stream on European blocking. My broader research interests include extreme weather, teleconnections, and subseasonal to seasonal predictability.
